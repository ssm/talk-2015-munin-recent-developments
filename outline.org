* Recent developments in munin

  Munin is a networked data gatherer and grapher.

  This is a few highlights from the Munin development branch in the
  first half of 2015, around version 2.1.12.

** Introduction

   A few things have happened in the munin development recently

*** Web interface rewritten

*** Munin HTTPD added

*** FastCGI scripts removed

** Web interface rewritten

   Munin was a web 1.0 (or web 0.1) holdout for many years.  Now,
   there is a modern web interface.

*** Responsive design
**** Fits various screen sizes
*** Uses javascript responsibly

    Javascript is used to enhance the web interface, but should not be
    required for it to work.

**** Example: filter

     Like a search, but limits the content the browser already has
     received.

** Munin HTTPD added
*** A simple web server

    A web server displaying munin master data.  It listens on
    http://localhost:4948/ by default.

    Much simpler implementation than the FastCGI scripts.

    Much easier to configure

    Much easier to debug

*** New features

    Each graph is available as .png, .ps, .eps, .pdf or .svg image, or
    as data with .xml, .json or .csv extension.

    Each page available as as webpage with .html extension, or as data
    with .xml or .json extension.

*** How?

**** start server

     (Needs munin-update to run first.  It will not have anything
     useful to show until then)

**** connect with browser

     http://your.munin.master.example.com:4948/

*** Simple web server

     A lot of features are already implemented by many web servers.
     Solution: proxy.

***** https
***** authentication

** FastCGI scripts removed
*** Problem: Hard to configure

    The web server configuration must match configuration in
    munin.conf for paths to be aligned.

    Environment variables must be set and passed correctly.

*** Problem: Support burden

    The single most time-consuming issue on the #munin channel on
    IRC.  "Getting dynamic graphing to work".

    Munin is a volunteer project, like many other Free Software
    projects. Using the developers' spare time on support takes time
    away from development.

*** Problem: multiple implementations

    Many FastCGI environments handle differently.  Some scrub away
    environment variables, some do not.

    The RRD cache daemon used for speeding up munin uses environment
    variables, meaning that graphing simply didn't work well under
    various hard-to-debug circumstances.
